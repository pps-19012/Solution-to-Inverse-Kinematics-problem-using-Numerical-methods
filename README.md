# Solution-to-Inverse-Kinematics-problem-using-Numerical-methods

### Abstract
Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem is defined as the problem of determining a set of appropriate joint configurations for
which the end effectors move to desired positions as smoothly, rapidly, and as accurately as possible. A few of the iterative
methods that solve tries to solve the problem have been described here. Further, we have prepared a MATLAB code that
uses one of the methods. We have also simulated the working of the methods in Unity Engine to help better visualize it.
